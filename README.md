This was a capstone EDA project on World-Bank-Analysis for analysing educational trends across various countries especially BRICS.

The data used is directly from the site of World Bank.

I was able to provide some really useful insights into the Educational trends, instituinal spends, budget for educational expenditure, tertiary to primary enrollment ratios and compare them for these countries.

Also gathered some useful insights from the EDA.
